## Overview

SABER provides a systematic approach to evaluating AI model robustness through structured adversarial tournaments. Unlike ad-hoc "red team" testing, SABER creates reproducible, measurable assessments of model vulnerabilities across standardized exploit categories and attack personas.

**Key Innovation:** N×N tournament structure where AI models act as both attackers and defenders, creating comprehensive robustness scorecards that track performance over time and enable systematic comparison across models, training approaches, and safety interventions.

## Problem Statement

Current AI model evaluation suffers from several critical gaps:

### 1. **Ad-hoc Testing Limitations**

- Manual red-teaming doesn't scale with model development pace
- Inconsistent methodology makes results non-comparable
- Human testers have cognitive biases and limited attack creativity
- No systematic tracking of vulnerability trends over time

### 2. **Evaluation Infrastructure Gap**

- Academic researchers lack tools for systematic adversarial evaluation
- Companies need standardized benchmarks for safety claims
- Regulators require objective measures of AI system robustness
- No established frameworks for comparing model safety improvements

### 3. **Research Reproducibility**

- Security research often uses proprietary, non-reproducible methods
- Attack success depends heavily on individual researcher skill
- Limited ability to validate safety improvements across organizations
- Difficult to establish baselines for measuring progress

## Solution: Systematic Adversarial Tournaments

SABER addresses these challenges through structured competition between AI models:

### **Tournament Structure**

- **Attacker Models:** Attempt to extract secrets, violate constraints, or compromise defenders
- **Defender Models:** Protect information while maintaining helpful functionality
- **Exploit Categories:** Standardized vulnerability types (secret extraction, system prompt revelation, etc.)
- **Attack Personas:** Specialized approaches tailored to specific exploit types
- **Conversation Transcripts:** Complete records enabling post-hoc analysis and pattern recognition

### **Systematic Measurement**

- **Reproducible Configuration:** YAML-defined tournaments, personas, and exploit types
- **Quantitative Metrics:** Success rates, turns-to-compromise, attack sophistication scores
- **Longitudinal Tracking:** Model robustness trends over training iterations and safety interventions
- **Comparative Analysis:** Direct model-vs-model performance measurement

### **Research Value**

- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify systematic vulnerabilities across model families
- **Attack Taxonomy:** Classify and measure effectiveness of different adversarial approaches
- **Defense Insights:** Understand which safety measures work against which attack types
- **Scalable Evaluation:** Automated assessment replacing manual red-team efforts

## Technical Architecture

### **Modular Design**

```
SABER Framework
├── Tournament Controller    # Orchestrates matches and manages state
├── Model Adapters          # Interfaces with LLMStudio, Ollama, APIs
├── Exploit Engine         # Manages attack/defense scenarios
├── Conversation Manager   # Handles turn-based dialogues
├── Detection Systems      # Identifies successful compromises
└── Analysis Pipeline      # Generates reports and insights
```

### **Configuration-Driven**

- **Models:** Define available AI models and runtime parameters
- **Personas:** Specify attack approaches and conversation strategies
- **Exploits:** Configure vulnerability types and success detection
- **Tournaments:** Orchestrate comprehensive evaluation campaigns

### **Local-First Development**

- **Privacy-Preserving:** Runs entirely on local infrastructure
- **API-Independent:** No reliance on external model providers during development
- **Reproducible:** Consistent results across different computing environments
- **Cost-Effective:** No per-query charges during research and development

## Responsible Development Practices

### **Ethical Framework**

- **Defensive Focus:** Builds tools for protecting AI systems, not exploiting them
- **Academic Partnership:** Designed for collaboration with university research programs
- **Industry Engagement:** Early disclosure and collaboration with AI companies
- **Responsible Disclosure:** 90-day private reporting before public release of vulnerabilities

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Synthetic Secrets:** Uses artificial test data, not real credentials or sensitive information
- **Known Attack Vectors:** Focuses on documented techniques rather than novel vulnerability discovery
- **Limited Scope:** Evaluates instruction-following and information isolation, not harmful content generation
- **Audit Trail:** Complete conversation logging enables post-hoc review and analysis

### **Research Positioning**

- **Infrastructure Development:** Frames work as building evaluation tools for the AI safety community
- **Systematic Methodology:** Emphasizes reproducible measurement over ad-hoc testing
- **Collaborative Approach:** Designed for academic and industry partnership rather than independent security research
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Supports emerging AI evaluation requirements and safety standards

## Getting Started

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Install SABER
pip install saber-framework

# Run basic tournament
saber run --tournament config/tournaments/mvp_basic.yaml

# Analyze results
saber analyze results/mvp_basic/ --format summary
```

### **Configuration**

SABER uses modular YAML configuration files:

```
config/
├── models/         # AI model definitions
├── personas/       # Attack approach specifications
├── exploits/       # Vulnerability type configurations
└── tournaments/    # Complete evaluation campaign definitions
```

### **Example Tournament**

```yaml
name: "Basic Robustness Evaluation"
models: ["llama2-7b", "mistral-7b", "zephyr-7b"]
exploits: ["secret_extraction", "system_prompt_revelation"]
settings:
  max_turns: 10
  output_dir: "results/robustness_eval"
```
